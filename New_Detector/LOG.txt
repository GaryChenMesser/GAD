Design of Detector

The reason why I want to refactor Detector
1 the detector is funcation based. There are some functions
with too long parameter list

The existing structure is not suitable for exploring. 
the relationship between 
1. Detector
2. OldDetector
3. MSDetector
is very weid.

I should use Class to replace is this relationship. 

Base Class for Detector

class Detector():
    def detect_one_window():
        pass
    def generator_norminal_PDF():
        pass
    def
