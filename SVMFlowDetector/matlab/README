This original matlab code written by R Taylor Lockle. <rtl@bu.edu>
for those who are familar with MATLAB.
email from Taylor illustrating these code:

Example Matlab code is attached. It requires libsvm to run (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/). The code is for the large flow size anomaly cases you sent to me. readtraintest.m reads the fs flows, trains the one-class SVM, and tests it. 

The features for this case are sort of special. The first n elements of the feature vector are the number of occurances of each IP address within a time window, the second n elements are the number of large sized flows. 

The flow-by-flow detector would be very similar, but instead of tabulating flows that occur within a window, you would just make the single flow features described in the draft of the paper.


*****************************************************
to run the test:
1. copy the *flow.txt and corresponding abnormal*.flow.txt file into this folder
open matlab
run 
>ip2int

run readtraintest with right parameter, the meaning of parameter is listed as
follows:

function readtraintest(ext,iplist,deltat,gamma,flowfn)
% Read in a scenario, train a one class SVM, and test its
% performance.
%
% ext - String of file name extension. e.g., ext = '2'
% iplist - List of IPs, as found by getiplist.m.
% deltat - Length of evaluation window, in seconds.
% gamma - Radial basis function parameter, for SVM kernel.
% flowfn - Optional. Name of .mat file containing flows contained
%          in the files referenced by ext, if they've already been read.
