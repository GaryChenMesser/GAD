=================================
Welcome to SADIT's documentation! 
=================================

Introduction
==================================
SADIT is a byproduct of research project **A Coordinated Approach to
Cyber-Situation Awarness Based on Traffic Anomaly Detection**.  It is the
acronym of **S**\ ystematic **A**\ nomaly **D**\ etection of **I**\ nternet
**T**\ raffic.  The motivation of SADIT is to make the comparison and the
validation of internet anomaly deteciton algorithmes super easy.  It provides
a collection of Internet Anomaly Detection algorithms proposed by several
researchers. Now it contains:

    1. Stochastic Anomaly Detector using Large Deviation Theory
    2. Deterministic Temporal Anomaly Detector using Support Vector Machine
    3. Deterministic Flow by Flow Detector using Support Vector Machine
    4. Anomaly Detection Techniques using ART theory

SADIT is not limited to the four algorithms listed above, its utimate goal is to
become a standard collection of a variety of internet anomaly detection
algorithms.

It also provides an easy-to-use tool to generate labeled flow records, which are
helpful in validatation and comparison of methods.

If you are a researcher interested in Internet Anomaly Detection, we strongly
encourage you to implement your algorithms following the APIs and data format of
SADIT so that you can easily compare your methods with exisiting algorithms in
SADIT. Your help will be highly appreciated if you can contribute your own
algorithm to the algorithm libray of SADIT. Feel free to contact me if you have
any question.

What's New
==================================
the version 1.0 is a result of big refactor of version 0.0. The refactor makes the code more
scalable and less buggy.
    - **Paradigm of Object-oriented programming**: The **Configure** module and **Detector** module have been rewritten under
      object-oriented paradigm. In version 0.0, all modules depends on the global
      settings file setting.py, which make the code more vulunerable to bugs. In this verison only 
      few scripts depend on settings.py. Classes are widely used to reduce the need to
      pass parameters around. In case that parameters passing is required, well-defined structures are used.
    - **Experiment**: A new folder ROOT/Experiment appears to contain different
      experiments. You can write your own scripts of Experiment and put them in
      this folder.
    - **Better Sensitivity Anaysis**: In the version 0.0, sensitivity anaysis is 
      done by change the global settings.py file and rerun the simulation. Since 
      settings.py is a typical python module,changing it during the run is really not 
      a good idea. In this version, special Experiment is designed to support
      sensitivity analysis.

Structure
================================
**SADIT** consists of  two parts. The first part is a collection of anomalies
detection algorithms. The second part is labeled flow record generator. The
follow sections will describe the two parts accordingly.

.. It also implement one algorithm proposed by `Jing Conan Wang <http://people.bu.edu/wangjing/>`_, Ronald Lockle Taylor and `Yannis Paschalidis <http://ionia.bu.edu/>`_ .Look at our `poster <http://people.bu.edu/wangjing/pdf/data_exfiltration-back.pdf>`_ for more information of our work

.. **configure**
    configure the simulator based on the description of anomaly in settings.py.
    In current version, it is **DOT file** needed by *fs*-simulator.
.. **simulator**
    Generate the traffic through simulation. In current version, it is a revised
    version of `fs-simulator <http://cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/#code>`_. It will read
    the **DOT file** generated by **configure** and generate a network flow
    file with Cisco Netflow version 5 binary format.
.. **detector**
..
    this module will read the network flow file generate by **simulator** and
    try to detect anomaly accordingly. In current version, the detector is based
    on one of our `paper <http://people.bu.edu/wangjing/html/AnomalyDetection.html>`_. Look at our `poster <http://people.bu.edu/wangjing/pdf/data_exfiltration-back.pdf>`_ for more information of our work.


Collection of Anomaly Detection Algorithm
------------------------------------
All the detection algorithms locates in the *ROOT/Detector* folder:

    - **SVMDetector.py** contains two SVM based anomaly detection algorithmes 
      1. SVM Temporal Detector and 2. SVM Flow by Flow Detector.
    - **StoDetector.py** contains two anomaly detection algorithms based on
      Large Deviation Theory.

Labeled Flow Records Generator 
------------------------------------
Labeled Flow Records Generator consists of a *Configurer* and a *Simulator*.
The *Simulator* part is essentially a revised FS Simulator developed by
researchers at UW Madison. *Configurer* first generate a flow specification (DOT
format) file with certain types of anomalies, then the *Simulator* will generate
flow records and corresponding labels.

Configurer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
*Configurer* generate the corresponding DOT file according to description of user
behaviour. The important concepts in *Configurer* are as follows:

    - **Generator**: description of a certain type of flow traffic. For
      examples, *Harpoon* generator represents `harpoon flows
      <http://cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/harpoon/>`_.  
    - **Behaviour**: description of temporal pattern. There are three types
      behaviour:
          - **Normal** behaviour is described by start time and duration.
          - **I.I.D** behaviour has a list of possible states, but one state
                       will be selected as current state every *t* seconds
                       according to certain probability distribution.
          - **Markov** the state in different time is not independtly and
                       identically distributed,  but is a Markov process

    - **Modulator**: combine *Behaviour* and *Generator*, basicially description
      of generator behaviour. There are three types of modulators, corresponding
      to three behaviours described above.
      
..    Two types of
      modulator are supported: **Normal** and **Markov**. The normal modulator
      is bascially the same with modulator in `fs simulator
      <http://cs-people.bu.edu/eriksson/papers/erikssonInfocom11Flow.pdf>`_,
      which is described by *(start, generator, profile)*.  We also implement a
      markov modulator which has markov behaviour.


    - **Node**: host in the network, has *modulator_list* attributes
    - **Edge**: connecting two network nodes, has *delay*, *capacity* attributes
    - **Network**: a collection of network nodes and edges
    - **Anomaly**: description of the anomaly. When an anomaly is injected into
      the network, some attributes in the network (*Node*, *Edge*) will be
      changed.

..
    **Generator**, **Modulator** and **Behaviour** can completely decribe the
    traffic of users. **Generator** describe the type of traffic. **Modulator**
    describe the duration. And **Behaviour** describes the action of users take each
    time.

..  **Generator** and **Modulator** are concepts in `fs simulator.
..  <http://cs-people.bu.edu/eriksson/papers/erikssonInfocom11Flow.pdf>`_. 
..  every *t* second it will the use will choose from two *states*.

Simulator
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Simulator is basically a revised version of fs simulator. We have added
support to export anoumalous flows(add label information).

  --feature_option FEATURE_OPTION
                        specify the feature option. feature option is a
                        dictionary describing the quantization level for each
                        feature. You need at least specify 'cluster' and
                        'dist_to_center'. Note that, the value of 'cluster' is
                        the cluster number. The avaliability of other features
                        depend on the data handler.
  --export_flows EXPORT_FLOWS
                        specify the file name of exported abnormal flows.
                        Default is not export
  --entropy_threshold ENTROPY_THRESHOLD
                        the threshold for entropy,
  --pic_name PIC_NAME   picture name for the detection result

The help document is quite clear, the only parameter I want clarify is
*--experiment*. It specify the experiment you want to execute. An **experiment**
is actually a executable python script in Experiment folder. 
..  I will take
..  *Experiment.py* as an example to describle experiment.
Avaliable experiments as follows:
    - **Experiment.py**: basic experiment which includes configuration,
      simulation and detection, which corresponds to generating the
      configuration files, generating the labeled flow records and detectng the
      anomalies in the records, respectively.
    - **Sens.py**: Do sensistive analysis by change the degree of of anomalies,
      run the detection algorithm accordingly and show results in the same
      figure.
    - **MarkovExperiment.py**: Similar with Experiment, but for Markov type of
      anomalies
    - **MarkovSens.py**: Sensitivity analysis of MarkovExperiment
    - **Eval.py**: Evaluation of the detection algorithmm calculate fpr, fnr and
      plot the ROC curve
    - **DetectArgSearch.py**: runs detection algortihms with all combinations of
      parameters and outputs the results to a folder, helps to select the
      optimal parameters.

In addition to the parameters in the command line, SADIT has some more tunable
parameters in **ROOT/settings.py**. you can customize **SADIT** through changing
parameters in **settings.py** file. Since it is a typical python script, so you can
use any non-trival python sentence in the **settings.py**.

    DETECTOR_DESC = dict(
            interval=20,
            win_size=200,

Want to implement your algorithm?
=====================================

Use the labeled flow records generator in fs simulator
-------------------------------------
The generated flows will be the *ROOT/Simulator* folder. The flows end with
*_flow.txt*, for example, n0_flow.txt is the network flows trough node 0. File
start with *abnormal_* is the exported abnormal flows correspondingly.

**A typical line is**
    textexport n0 1348412129.925416 1348412129.925416 1348412130.070733 10.0.7.4:80->10.0.8.5:53701 tcp 0x0 n1 5 4215 FSA

**line format**
    prefix nodename time flow_start_time flow_end_time src_ip:src_port->dst_ip:dst_port protocol payload destname unknown flowsize unknown

After finishing your detection algorihms, you need to add the corresponding
class name to **detector_map** in *ROOT/Detector/API.py*. Then you can implement
your own experiment to compare your algorithms with existing algorithms in
SADIT. Look at the sample examples in  *ROOT/Experiemnt/* folder. Your can run
your experiment by typing ::

    ./run.py -e <Your Experiment Name>

Use Other flow records
-------------------------------------
SADIT does not only support the text output format of fs simulator, but also
several other types of flow data. The handler classes locate in the
*DataHandler.py* and *DataHandler_xflow.py*
**DataFile**
    - **PreloadHardDistFile** hard disk flow file generated by fs-simulator. It
      will preload all the flow file into memory, so it cannot deal with flow
      file larger than your memery
    - **PreloadHardDistFile_pcap2netflow** hard disk flow file generated by
      `pcap2netflow <https://bitbucket.org/hbhzwj/pcap2netflow/src>`_ tool(the
      format of `flowd-reader <http://www.mindrot.org/projects/softflowd/>`_)
    - **PreloadHardDistFile_xflow**, hard disk flow file generated by xflow tool
    - **SQLFile_SperottoIPOM2009**, labeled data stored in mysql server provided
      by `simpleweb.org <http://traces.simpleweb.org/traces/netflow/netflow2/>`_


The following class is the abstract base class for all data files

.. code-block:: python

    class Data(object):
        """virtual base class for data. Data class deals with any implementation
        details of the data. it can be a file, a sql data base, and so on, as long
        as it support the pure virtual methods defined here.
        """
        def get_fea_slice(self, rg=None, rg_type=None):
            """ get a slice of feature
            - **rg** is the range for the slice
            - **rg_type** is the type for range, it can be ['flow'|'time']
            """
            abstract_method()

        def get_max(self, fea, rg=None, rg_type=None):
            """ get the max value of feature during a range
            - **fea** is a list of feature name
            - **rg** is the range
            - **rg_type** is the range type
            the output is the a list of element which contains the max
            value of the feature in **fea**
            """
            abstract_method()
        def get_min(self, fea, rg=None, rg_time=None):
            """ get min value of feature within a range. see **get_max** for
            the meaning of the parameters
            """
            abstract_method()

It defines the operation we can do with data files. The four
algorithmes we implemented requires **get_fea_slice**, **get_max** and
**get_min** operations. You can implement more operations, but at least
implement these three operations.

Optionally, you can implement a handler class that will manipulate the
DataFile and and some useful quantities that may be useful to you algorithms.
For example, we implemented **HardDiskFileHandler** with get_em() function to
get probability distribution of the flows, which is useful for the stochastic
approaches. If you just need the raw data, you can define simple handler class
with data file object you want to use as member variable.

Then you just need to add your data_handler to **data_handler_handle_map**
defined in *ROOT/Detector/API.py*

..  **DataFileHandler**
   [HardDiskFileHandler]: 
   [HardDiskFileHandler_pcap2netflow]: h    
     [HardDiskFileHandler_xflow]: 
   [SQLDataFileHandler_SperottoIPOM2009]:
