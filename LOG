MarkovNode

Network should be indepedent to NNode

there should be a initialization parameter in the constructor 

how to descript markov behaviour
start-end. transition

we use profile to describe a modulator in normal node

we can also use  profile to describe a modulator in markov node.
simply use profile

time information. 
only consider the model-free case. 

the margin probability is th probability that the received flow belongs to which states

the joint probability is the probability that received flow belongs to which states.

what we are trying to do this to characterize the

as simple as possible. 

different temporal information. 

A node send same traffic to server. 
but the difference is the temporal different. 

for the pespective of senders, there should be a probability distribution. 
for a given time spot. the sender need to decide
    1. When to send the next packet
    2. to whom it should send the packet
    3. which type of flow it should send ---> specify the marginal distribution. 

parameter of senders. 
    1. specify the mariginal distribution
    2. specify the relationship between the marginal distribution

marginal distribution
    1. decide which type of flow it should send

joint distribution
    1. specify to whom it should send the packet.

We make the first parameter fixed to be the possion distribution. 

if we change the pdf of "to whom it should send the packet", the flow rate will change. 
    so this term is not specifed single probability distribution.

the problem consits of two parts:
    [1], is the generation part.
    [2], detection part 
to decide to whom the packet should be sent. 
We need to consider the problem from the pespective of window.
We determine the number of flows that will be sent in on window.
Then we determine the destination of each slot repectively.

We need to keep the portion for each server to be the same. However, the time will be different. 

for example, in the normal case, the slots can be distributed evenly in terms of time.
In the abnormal case, the previous parts will have a lot of flows to server 1, while in the second
part, a lot flows will have destination to server 2


we need have some sort of variables description

for each sender X. suppose X_i is a random variable indicating the type of the flow that will be send to sever i.
the send will maintain such as random variable


consider the marignal
there should be a general distribution

implementation.
[Configure] part
I need create a new class of Node.
    class ProbNode: node send traffic with certain kind of probability
in this class

the freedom degree we have. 
    1. we can add modulator to the server node. the modulator need to have,
    (start time, profile, generator)
    2. generator is a source with parameter flow_arrival_rate, flow_size_mean,
    flow_size_var
    3. flow_arrival is possion distributed.
    4. one generator only target for one server.
    5. we need select different servers, means select different types of
    generators.
    6. the original markov node method cannot work


ideas:
    1 a pool of generators. each generator represents one type of flows to one
    specific server. 
    2.our task is to select generators from the pool.
    3. we need to change the way of selections so that the distribution for each
    sever doesn't change at all.

    X_1, X_2, ..., X_n, joint distribution.
    for each time, we get a sequence of  X_1, X_2, ....  X_n
    P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) is the probability distribution we want to
    characterize
    
    the possible states are: 1 state for each quantized flow, and one state 
    for sending no flows at all.

    we need to maintains the marginal distribution for this set of variables
    unchanged.

    we need have a table. ---> this table specify the joint distribution probability distribution
    for the 

I need a method to keep each colomn and row unchanged, while change the term. We
need a scale value to determine the degree of change.


the previous analysis is only for a specific time spot. In generaal, it is a
stochastic process.

==========================================================
Another important idea is that suppose the behaviour of
users don't change, but the network condition changes. See
what happens.

class MVBehaviour(MarkovBehaviour):
    """The traffic is generated according to multi-variable distribution
    if there are n servers, then the joint distribution will be n dimension
    matrix. For each component, there are n possible values. So we need n possible
    generators.

    if we have the distribution matrix. we just generate random variable

an important function is to generate a random value according to some certain 
probability distribution.

we need generate matrix with the same size of probability distribution.
