                    Statitical Anomaly Detector of Internet Traffic (SADIT)
What is it?
-------------
SADIT aims to provide research community an easy-to-use tool to validate and test
statistical anomaly detecting method in both simulated and real environment.

In the current developing stage, we focus on simulation. SADIT uses fs(flow-max)
nework simulator, an efficient & light-weight network simulator developed by UW Madison, to simulate 
the network flow traffic. 
For more information about fs(flowmax) simulator, visit http://cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/#code
Also refer paper "Efficient Network-wide Flow Record Generation" Infocom 2011.

SADIT now has the following three modules:
** Configure **
fs-simulator can only parse DOT file. this module will generate different types
of DOTS file according the scenaios specfied in settings.py

** Simulator **
this is a revised fs simulator which supports:
1. export abnormal flows record

** Detector **
Implements anomaly detection algorithm in paper
"STATICAL APPROACHES TO DATA EXFILTRATION DETECTION" submitted to CDC2012.


how to custimize SADIT.

Start from allinone.py 
run() will run the configurer, simulator and detector consectutively. 
main() will do the sensitivity analysiss
