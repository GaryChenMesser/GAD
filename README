                    Statitical Anomaly Detector of Internet Traffic (SADIT)
What is it?
-------------
SADIT aims to provide research community an easy-to-use tool to validate and test
statistical anomaly detecting method in both simulated and real environment.

In the current developing stage, we focus on simulation. SADIT uses fs(flow-max)
nework simulator, an efficient & light-weight network simulator developed by UW Madison, to simulate 
the network flow traffic. 
For more information about fs(flowmax) simulator, visit http://cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/#code
Also refer paper "Efficient Network-wide Flow Record Generation" Infocom 2011.

SADIT now has the following three modules:
** Configure **
fs-simulator can only parse DOT file. this module will generate different types
of DOTS file according the scenaios specfied in settings.py

** Simulator **
this is a revised fs simulator which supports:
1. export abnormal flows record

** Detector **
Implements anomaly detection algorithm in paper
"STATICAL APPROACHES TO DATA EXFILTRATION DETECTION" submitted to CDC2012.

Run
-------------
please type the ./cmdsadit and help documents will appear

You need to specify the environment variable SADIT_ROOT before running it. 

    export SADIT_ROOT=<path_of_your_sadit_installation>

Installation
-------------
this software depends on all softwares that fs-simulate depends on:
- ipaddr (2.1.1) 
  `Get_<http://ipaddr-py.googlecode.com/files/ipaddr-2.1.1.tar.gz>`
- networkx (1.0)
  `Get_<http://networkx.lanl.gov/download/networkx/networkx-1.0.1.tar.gz>`
- pydot (1.0.2) `Get_<http://pydot.googlecode.com/files/pydot-1.0.2.tar.gz>`
- pyparsing (1.5.2)
  `Get_<http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/pyparsing/pyparsing/pyparsing-1.5.2/pyparsing-1.5.2.tar.gz?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fpyparsing%2Ffiles%2Fpyparsing%2Fpyparsing-1.5.2%2F&ts=1332828745&use_mirror=softlayer>`
- py-radix (0.5)
  `Get_<http://py-radix.googlecode.com/files/py-radix-0.5.tar.gz>`

besides: it requires
python-dev
numpy
matplotlib

if you are in debain base system. you can simple use
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python-numpy
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
